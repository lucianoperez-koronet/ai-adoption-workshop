# Demo prep (5-minute slot)

Use this skill when preparing your team’s 5-minute demo so you cover **clarity** and **replicability** and stay on time.

## Overview

You have one 5-minute slot. The judges will score: Effective use of AI, Practical value, Innovation, Clarity of explanation, Replicability. This skill helps you structure the demo and the story.

## When to use

- In the last 20–30 minutes of the build session.
- When rehearsing the demo.
- Right before your slot (quick checklist).

## Checklist

1. **Script** – Write a minimal script: intro (who, what, why) → live demo (3–4 steps) → how you used AI → how to run it / where to read more.
2. **Timing** – Aim for ~1 min intro, ~2–2.5 min demo, ~1–1.5 min “how we used AI” + replicability; leave a small buffer.
3. **One person talks** – Or clear handoffs; avoid overlapping.
4. **Clarity** – Use simple words; say “we used Cursor + MCP for X” and “rules/Skills are in the repo.”
5. **Replicability** – Point to README and `docs/SKILLS.md`; say “clone the repo and follow the docs to run it and reuse our AI setup.”
6. **Run through once** – Do a full 5-minute rehearsal and cut if over.
