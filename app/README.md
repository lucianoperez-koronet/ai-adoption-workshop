# App – your project goes here

This folder is the **placeholder for your team’s project** during the Koronet AI Adoption Workshop.

## What to do

- **Option A:** Replace this folder with your own app (e.g. clone a starter into `app/` or move your code here).
- **Option B:** Create your app inside `app/` (e.g. `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`, or Next.js, or a simple Node/TS script).

Keep the rest of the repo (`.cursor/`, `docs/`, `skills/`) at the root so Cursor rules and Skills still apply and the setup stays **replicable**.

## After you add your app

- Ensure there is a clear way to run it (e.g. `npm run dev`, `npm start`).
- Document in the **root README** or in **docs/DEMO_CHECKLIST.md** how to run it and what you built.
- Add a short “How we used AI” section for the demo and for the replicability criterion.

Come ready to build.
