# 5-minute demo checklist

Use this before your team’s 5-minute demo slot to align with the evaluation criteria.

---

## Before the demo

- [ ] **One clear goal** – You can state in one sentence what you built and why it’s useful (practical value).
- [ ] **Demo path** – You have a short script: open what, click what, show what (max 3–4 steps so you stay under 5 min).
- [ ] **AI story** – You can explain in 1–2 minutes how you used AI (Cursor, MCP, rules, Skills) during the build.
- [ ] **Repo is ready** – `app/` (or your project) runs; if judges want to try it, you know the exact commands (e.g. `npm run dev`).
- [ ] **Replicability** – README or DEMO_CHECKLIST has a “How we used AI” section so others can copy your approach.

## Evaluation criteria (quick map)

| Criterion | What to show in the demo |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Effective use of AI** | Show or describe: rules, Skills, MCP usage, deliberate prompts. |
| **Practical value** | Demo the thing; say who it’s for and what problem it solves. |
| **Innovation** | Highlight what’s novel (idea or use of AI). |
| **Clarity of explanation** | Short, clear narrative: what we built → how we used AI → how to run it. |
| **Replicability** | Point to docs and repo; “another team can clone and follow SKILLS.md / rules.” |

## Suggested 5-minute structure

1. **0:00–0:45** – Who we are, what we built, why it matters (practical value + innovation).
2. **0:45–2:30** – Live demo (same path you rehearsed).
3. **2:30–3:30** – How we used AI (Cursor, MCP, rules, Skills) – effective use + clarity.
4. **3:30–4:00** – How to run it and where to read more (replicability).
5. **4:00–5:00** – Buffer for questions or wrap-up.

Adjust to your style; keep it simple and under 5 minutes.
