## Evaluation criteria ↔ Playbook mindset

| Criterion | What it means for the workshop | Playbook alignment |
|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Effective use of AI** | Use Cursor, MCP, and AI in a structured way (not random prompts). | Follow role-based playbook practices; use tools deliberately. |
| **Practical value** | Build something that solves a real problem or improves a workflow. | Focus on high-impact use cases in the SDLC. |
| **Innovation** | Creative or novel use of AI or product idea. | Experiment within guardrails; show what’s possible. |
| **Clarity of explanation** | Others can follow how you built it and how AI helped. | Document decisions; explain prompts and workflows. |
| **Replicability** | Another team could reuse your approach or repo. | Use repo rules, Skills, and docs so others can copy. |

## Principles to keep in mind

1. **Structured over ad-hoc** – Prefer rules, Skills, and clear prompts over one-off chats.
2. **Human in the loop** – Review AI output; don’t ship without understanding it.
3. **Reusability** – Write down what worked (in Skills, README, or DEMO_CHECKLIST) so others can replicate.
4. **Safety and quality** – Stay within company guidelines; run builds/tests when relevant.
