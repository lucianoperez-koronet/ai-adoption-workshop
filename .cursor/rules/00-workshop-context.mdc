# Koronet AI Adoption Workshop – Repo Context

## What this repo is for

This repository supports the **Koronet AI Adoption Workshop**: a 3-hour AI-powered build session followed by a 5-minute demo per team. The goal is to move from ad-hoc AI usage to **structured, high-impact** use of AI in the software development lifecycle.

## Format

- **Teams:** 3–4 people per group
- **Build:** 3 hours with Cursor + MCP + rules + Skills
- **Demo:** 5 minutes per team
- **Evaluation:** Effective use of AI, Practical value, Innovation, Clarity of explanation, Replicability

## How to use AI in this repo

1. **Cursor rules** (this folder) – Define how the AI should behave (workshop context, MCP preference, quality checks).
2. **MCP** – Use available MCP tools (GitHub, browser, Figma, shadcn-ui, etc.) when they fit the task; prefer real actions over simulated ones.
3. **Skills** – See `skills/` and `docs/SKILLS.md` for task-specific guidance (effective AI use, demo prep).
4. **Playbook** – Align with the Komet AI Playbook; full text in `docs/AI_PLAYBOOK_BY_ROLE.md`, summary in `docs/AI_PLAYBOOK_SUMMARY.md`. Confluence: [AI Playbooks by Role](https://vertical.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DDI/pages/5852954626/AI+Playbooks+by+Role).

## App location

The team’s project lives in **`app/`**. It may be empty at first; replace or fill it with your chosen stack (e.g. Next.js, Vite, Node script). Keep the rest of the repo (rules, docs, skills) so the setup stays **replicable**.

## Quality

When the project in `app/` has a build: run `npm run build` (or equivalent) from the relevant root after making changes, and fix any failures before considering the task done.

## Language

Use **English** for code, commits, and documentation in this repo.
