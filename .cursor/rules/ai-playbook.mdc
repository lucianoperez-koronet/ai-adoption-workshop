# Komet AI Playbook (hackathon context)

This repo follows the **Komet AI Playbook** for the Koronet AI Adoption Workshop. Use it to choose the right AI mode and to structure prompts.

## Quick Reference: Plan → Agent Workflow

- **PROMPT** → describe the task  
- **PLAN** → AI maps the steps (use for multi-file / research tasks)  
- **AGENT** → AI edits the code  
- **VERIFY** → you test and review  

| Step | Cursor | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Plan** | Plan mode / Cmd+L | Multi-file changes, new features, refactors |
| **Agent** | Agent mode / Cmd+I | Execute the plan: edit files, run commands |
| **Inline Chat** | Ctrl+K on selection | Single-file fixes, quick explanations, simplify |
| **Rules/Skills** | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `skills/` | Project conventions so AI follows them automatically |

**When to use Plan → Agent vs Inline Chat:**

- **Plan → Agent:** Any change touching 2+ files, or requiring research across the codebase.
- **Inline Chat:** Single-block fixes, syntax review, quick explanations.

## Full playbook

The complete playbook (Backend, Fullstack, Tech Lead scenarios, prompt templates, tips & anti-patterns) is in **`docs/AI_PLAYBOOK_BY_ROLE.md`**. Read or reference it when suggesting workflows, prompts, or when to use Plan vs Agent vs Inline.

## Do / Don’t (reminder)

- **Do:** Start in Plan for multi-file work; use rules/Skills for conventions; run build/test after Agent changes; one task per chat.
- **Don’t:** Accept over-simplified code without review; skip Plan for large features; assume the AI remembers project rules across sessions (use rules/Skills).
