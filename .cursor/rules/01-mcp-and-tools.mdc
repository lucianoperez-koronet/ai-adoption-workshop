# MCP and tool usage

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

When the user or the task can benefit from an MCP tool, **use it** instead of describing or simulating the action in text. Examples:

- **GitHub** – Creating/updating repos, branches, files, PRs, issues (use MCP; do not use the `gh` CLI – the user has it configured for another account).
- **Browser / Chrome DevTools** – Navigating, taking snapshots, filling forms, running demos or E2E flows.
- **Figma** – Fetching design data or exporting assets when a Figma URL or file key is provided.
- **shadcn-ui** – Fetching components or blocks for UI scaffolding.
- **Docker / Postman** – When the task involves containers, API collections, or mocks.

## Git and GitHub

- Use **git in the terminal** (e.g. `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git branch`) for local operations in this repo.
- Use **GitHub MCP** for remote operations (create repo, push files, create PR, etc.). Do **not** use the `gh` CLI.

## When no MCP tool fits

Proceed with code, file edits, or terminal commands as usual. Prefer the simplest approach that meets the evaluation criteria (practical value, clarity, replicability).
